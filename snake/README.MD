# Snake 

Most of the code is not mine.

## Things upgraded:
 1. After the snake hits a wall, the game does not end but the snake appears again from the opposite wall.
 2. I upgraded the window size for a full screen experience (its a noob tactic i used)
 3. Added a key to quit the game

## How to play
 1. Use arrow keys to navigate
 2. To quit the game press "LCTRL + C" or cannibalism.
